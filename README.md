## Instructions

This is a small project to demonstrate how to get the volume of a:

- Sphere
- Cube
- Tetrahedron


The application.java class can be run directly to print out all of the values for the different sample

OR alternatively you can run the unit tests I have written via the IDE or by running the maven clean install command:

    mvn clean install
